# DDLC iOS
DDLC ported to iOS. Check the releases.
Numbers (eg 1.0) are vanilla DDLC
Names (eg AMWY) are modded DDLC

I don't make mods, I just stick it on top of my original port.
UnRPYC and Ren'py Script Decompiler are used to RE DDLC.

Credit to saber-nyan for the Android port, from which I stole several things.
